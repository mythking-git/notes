## 6.1 - Trigonometric functions

The simplest definitions of the trig functions are in terms of the ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle for values of the angle $$\theta$$. They are:

&#x20;                               $$\text{sin }\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$           $$\text{cos }\theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$                $$\text{tan }\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

You can get the values of common angles with the "special triangles":

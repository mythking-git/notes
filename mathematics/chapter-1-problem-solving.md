| <p>A implies B<br>If A then B</p>       | A $$\implies$$ B                 | A is a sufficient condition for B |
| <p>A is implied by B<br>If B then A</p> | A $$\impliedby$$ B               | A is a necessary condition for B  |
| A implies, and is implied by, B         | A $$\iff$$ B                     |                                   |
| A does not implied B                    | A $$\rlap{\quad\not}\implies$$ B |                                   |

The converse of a theorem is where the $\implies$ symbol is flipped to $\impliedby$ to express an idea

Thus, the triangle $ABC$, Pythagoras' theorem states\
$$Angle {BCA} = 90^\circ \implies {AB}^2 = {BC}^2 + {CA}^2$$\
and its converse is\
$$Angle {BCA} = 90^\circ \impliedby {AB}^2 = {BC}^2 + {CA}^2$$\
As such, this can be defined as\
$$Angle BCA = 90^\circ \iff {AB}^2 = {BC}^2 + {CA}^2$$

## 1.3 Proofs

#### Proof by exhaustion

#### Proof by deduction

Step-by-step, usually algebraically, i.e.\


_The sum of two consecutive squares is always odd._

Let $$n^2$$ be a square number, therefore\
$$(n+1)^2$$ is the next square number.\
The sum would be:

$$n^2+(n+1)^2 \\= n^2 + n^2 + 2n + 1 \\=2n^2 + 2n + 1 \\= 2(n^2+n) + 1$$

2 multiplied by any number is even.\
$$\therefore$$ an even number plus 1 is odd

#### Proof by contradiction

#### Disproving a conjecture

Find any example where this isn't true i.e.\


_All multiples of 3 are multiples of 6_\
$$3 \times 3 = 9$$\
$$9 \div 6 \neq \Bbb{Z}$$

# Chapter 2 - Surds and indices

{% hint style="info" %}
Chapter 2 is a prerequisite for Chapter 3, and requires a solid understanding to continue.
{% endhint %}

## 2.1 - Using and manipulating surds

Numbers involving square roots (or even root powers) which cannot be written as rational numbers such as $$\sqrt{2}$$, are commonly referred to as surds. They display a surds' true value as calculators will have to only give an approximation of their value.

$$\sqrt{5} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{5}} \text{ and } \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}$$ <mark style="background-color:blue;">Surd manipulation is an important skill</mark>

### Rationalising the denominator

The name of the technique used to remove a surd from the denominator of a fraction, i.e.,

$$\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} (1) \\ = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ = 2\sqrt{2}$$

## 2.2 - Working with indices

### General formulae $$a^m = a \times a \times a \times \text{... m times ...} \times a \\ a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} \\ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} \\ a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n} \\ a^0 = 1 \\ a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} \\ a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (^n\sqrt{a})^m$$

### Mixed Bases

If an indices problem involves mixed bases, you need to split them with the rule:\
$$(a \times b)^n = a^n \times b^n$$\
For example, $$6^3 = (2 \times 3)^3 = 2^3 \times 3^3$$\
\
_Simplify_ $$5^{\frac{1}{2}} - 5^{\frac{3}{2}} + 5^{\frac{5}{2}}$$:\
This can be written as:\
$$\sqrt{5} - 5\sqrt{5}+5^2\sqrt{5} \\ = (1-5+25)\sqrt{5} \\ = 21\sqrt{5}$$

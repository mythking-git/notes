# Chapter 14 - Data Collection

## 14.1 - Problem solving

### Problem solving cycle

1. **Problem specification and analysis** - understand the problem and possible ways of collecting the data.
2. **Information collection** - Collect the data in relation to how accurate it should be, a census should collect all possible information from the whole population.
3. **Processing and representation** - Digest, cleaning, and represent the data on the most efficient diagram you can.
4. **Interpretation** - This is where you draw a conclusion from you results and see if this alines with your hypothesis.&#x20;

## 14.2 - Sampling

### Simple random sampling

Use of a calculator or random number chart to select items in a frame, ordered so they can be selected based on that random value.

### Stratified sampling

Separating a frame into sub-groups, known as strata, you then sample an amount of each strata proportional to its population. This is called **proportional stratified sampling**.&#x20;

The selection of the items to be sampled can be done by simple random sampling. It also gives you useful information about the individual strata.

### Cluster sampling

As before, start with sub-groups of a population, but in this case they are now called clusters. Each  cluster should be representative of their whole population. You then go to a few areas in the selected sample site, and take readings at each place.&#x20;

### Systematic sampling

Systematic sampling is used in ordered data, to take a sample at a fixed interval or step, i.e., every 50th item produced by a machine.

### Quota sampling

A fixed amount of the population based on features, usually to carry out an opinion poll, for example, 4 men, 3 women, and 5 teenagers. This should be carried out in a unbiased way.&#x20;

### Opportunity sampling

As the name implies, this method is used when a sample is readily available, until a quota is filled. This is the most biased method however is by far the easiest.

### Self-selecting sample

This is when people volunteer to take part, this is often used in online surveys or on the street. This should not be used in a serious research.

# Jean-Robert Argand

* Born in Geneva, Argand managed a bookstore in Paris where he published his idea of the geometrical interpretation of complex numbers on his own plane - the Argand diagram.
* He was the first to rigorously prove the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental\_theorem\_of\_algebra), in which he stated the solutions of polynomials with complex coefficients, rather than just real coefficients.
* He was not a well-accredited mathematician, did not belong to any mathematical organisations, and a large portion of his life and education at unknown. He was a hobbyist, more than a professional mathematician.&#x20;

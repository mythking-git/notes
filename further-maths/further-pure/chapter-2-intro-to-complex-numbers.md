# Chapter 2 - Intro to complex numbers

## 2.1 Extending the number system

[chapter-1-problem-solving.md](../../mathematics/pure/chapter-1-problem-solving.md "mention")

As in regular mathematics, there are number bases, complex numbers are an extension of this outside of the real $$(\Bbb{R})$$ numbers, they are the complex numbers $$(\Bbb{C})$$.

For example:\
$$x^2 + 9 = 0 \iff x^2 = -9 \iff x = 3\sqrt{-1} \iff x = \pm3i$$&#x20;

This also works with the quadratic formula:\
$$z^2 - 6z + 58 = 0 \\ z = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 58}}{2 \times 1} \\ = \frac{6 \pm 14i}{2} \\ = 3 \pm 7i$$\
$$\therefore \text{there are two roots 3+7i and 3-7i}$$

The $$3$$ is the called the real part of the complex number and is denoted as $$Re(z)$$\
The $$7i$$ is called the imaginary part and is denoted as $$Im(z)$$

### ± Addition and Subtraction&#x20;

**Addition**: add the r

eal part and add the imaginary parts.\
For example, $$(3+4i)+(2-8i) =  5 - 4i$$

**Subtraction**: subtract the real parts and add the imaginary parts.\
For example, $$(6-9i)-(1+6i) = 5 -15i$$

### × Multiplying

**Multiplication**: multiply out the brackets in the usual way and simplify.\
For example, $$(7+2i)(3-4i) \\ = 21 - 28i + 6i - 8i^2 \\ = 21 - 22i - 8(-1) \\ = 29 - 22i$$

### Equality of complex numbers

Two complex numbers $$z=x+yi$$ and $$w=u+vi$$ are equal if both $$x=u$$ and $$y=v$$. If $$x \neq u$$ or $$y \neq v$$, or both, then $$z \neq w$$ are not equal. As a result, when solving an equation, you can **equate the coefficients** separately.&#x20;

## 2.2 Division of complex numbers

### Complex conjugates

A complex conjugate is $$x-yi$$ as it is the conjugate of $$x+yi$$. If $$x+yi = z$$ then the complex conjugate is $$z^*$$.

_Show that_ $$z+z^*$$ _and_ $$zz^*$$, where $$z=3+5i$$ _are both real:_\
$$\text{i) }z + z^* = (3+5i) + (3-5i) \iff 6$$\
$$\text{ii) }zz^* = (3+5i)(3-5i) \\ = 9 +15i-15i-25i^2 \\ = 9+25 \\=34$$

### Dividing complex numbers&#x20;

Dividing by a complex number is equivalent to rationalising the denominator of a real fraction, where you multiply the complex fraction by its complex conjugate, i.e.,\
$$\frac{2}{3-5i} = \frac{2}{3-5i} \times \frac{3+5i}{3+5i}  \\= \frac{6-10i}{34} \\= \frac{3}{17}+\frac{5}{17}i$$

## 2.3 Representing complex numbers geometrically

A complex number $$x+yi$$can be represented by a point with Cartesian coordinates $$(x,y)$$ on an Argand diagram where $$x = x$$ on the real axis and $$y = yi$$ on the imaginary axis.

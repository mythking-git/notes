# Chapter 2 - Intro to complex numbers

## 2.1 Extending the number system

[chapter-1-problem-solving.md](../../mathematics/chapter-1-problem-solving.md "mention")

As in regular mathematics, there are number bases, complex numbers are an extension of this outside of the real $$(\Bbb{R})$$ numbers, they are the complex numbers $$(\Bbb{C})$$.

For example:\
$$x^2 + 9 = 0 \iff x^2 = -9 \iff x = 3\sqrt{-1} \iff x = \pm3i$$&#x20;

This also works with the quadratic formula:\
$$z^2 - 6z + 58 = 0 \\ z = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 58}}{2 \times 1} \\ = \frac{6 \pm 14i}{2} \\ = 3 \pm 7i$$\
$$\therefore \text{there are two roots 3+7i and 3-7i}$$

The $$3$$ is the called the real part of the complex number and is denoted as $$Re(z)$$\
The $$7i$$ is called the imaginary part and is denoted as $$Im(z)$$

### ± Addition and Subtraction&#x20;

**Addition**: add the real part and add the imaginary parts.\
For example, $$(3+4i)+(2-8i) =  5 - 4i$$

**Subtraction**: subtract the real parts and add the imaginary parts.\
For example, $$(6-9i)-(1+6i) = 5 -15i$$

### × Multiplying

**Multiplication**: multiply out the brackets in the usual way and simplify.\
For example, $$(7+2i)(3-4i) \\ = 21 - 28i + 6i - 8i^2 \\ = 21 - 22i - 8(-1) \\ = 29 - 22i$$

### ÷ Dividing

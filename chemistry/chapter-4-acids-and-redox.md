# Chapter 4 - Acids and redox

## 4.1 - Acids, bases, and neutralisation

### Acids

All acids contain hydrogen in their formulae. When dissolved in water an acid releases hydrogen ions as protons, $$\text{H}^+$$, into the solutions.

A **strong acid**, such as hydrochloric acid, $$\text{HCl}$$, completely **dissociates** in an aqueous solution.&#x20;

$$\text{HCl}_{\text{(aq)}} \rightarrow \text{H}^+_{\text{(aq)}} + \text{Cl}^-_{\text{(aq)}}$$

Whereas a **weak acid**, such as ethanoic acid, $$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$$, only releases a small proportion of its available hydrogen atoms into solutions, this is known as **partially dissociating**.

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}_{\text{(aq)}} \	\rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+{\text{(aq)}} + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-_{\text{(aq)}}$$

It is important to note that each molecule of ethanoic acid contains four hydrogen atoms, but only one hydrogen atom is released, and of that about one in every hundred dissociates, so ethanoic acid is a weak acid.&#x20;

### Bases and alkalis

Metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, and ammonia, are classified as bases. A base **neutralises** an acid to form a salt. Common bases are:

| Metal Oxides   | Metal carbonates           | Alkalis         |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| $$\text{MgO}$$ | $$\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3$$ | $$\text{NaOH}$$ |
| $$\text{CaO}$$ | $$\text{CaCO}_3$$          | $$\text{KOH}$$  |
| $$\text{CuO}$$ | $$\text{CuCO}_3$$          | $$\text{NH}_3$$ |

An **alkali** is a base that dissolves in water releasing hydroxide ions ($$\text{OH}^-$$) into the solution.&#x20;

### Neutralisation

In the neutralisation of an acid, $$\text{H}^+_{\text{(aq)}}$$ ions react with a base to form a salt $$\text{H}^+$$ ions from the acid are replaced by metal or ammonium ions from the base.

$$\underset{acid}{\text{HCl}_\text{(aq)}} + \underset{base}{\text{NaOH}_{\text{(aq)}}} \leftrightharpoons \underset{salt}{\text{NaCl}_{\text{(aq)}}} + \underset{water}{\text{H}_2\text{O}_{\text{(l)}}}$$

or ionic equation:

$$\text{H}^+_\text{(aq)} + \text{OH}^-_\text{(aq)} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}_2\text{O}_\text{(l)}$$

## 4.2 - Acid-base titrations

A **titration** is a technique used to accurately measure the volume of one solution that reacts exactly with another solution. They can be used for:

* finding the concentration of a solution
* identification of unknown chemicals
* finding the purity of a substance

A standard solution of known concentration. A **volumetric flask** is used to make up a standard solution very accurately. The volumetric flasks that you will use are manufactured to the typical tolerances below:&#x20;

* a $$100cm^3$$ volumetric flask: $$\pm 0.20 cm^3$$
* a $$250cm^3$$ volumetric flash: $$\pm 0.30cm^3$$

## 4.3 - Redox&#x20;

The **oxidation number** is based on a set of rules that apply to atoms and can be thought of as the number of electrons involved in bonding to a different element.&#x20;

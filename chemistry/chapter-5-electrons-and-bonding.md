# Chapter 5 - Electrons and bonding

5.1 - Electron structure

An orbital is an electron cloud where within the area 2, 6, 10, or 14 electrons may be found.

The image above shows the order the electron orbitals are filled due to their energy. This is in the order: $$1s^2,2s^2,2p^6,3s^2,3p^6,4s^2,3d^{10}...$$ etc.

The electron configuration can also be shown in spin diagrams as shown below.

## 5.2 - Ionic bonding

**Ionic bonding** is the electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions. It holds together cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions) in ionic compounds.

The simplest way of showing this is with a dot and cross diagram, like this one,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Example of ionic bonding - <span class="math">\text{Ca} + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow \text{CaCl}_2</span></p></figcaption></figure>

Each ion in an ionic compound attracts oppositely charged ions in all directions.

This results in a **giant ionic lattice** structure containing billions of billions of ions, that's why we use the empirical formula to display them, this is the lowest whole number ratio of each ion in the compound.

### Properties of ionic compounds

Ionic compounds have very **high melting and boiling points** as a large amount of energy is required to overcome the electrostatic forces of attraction. The melting points are higher for lattices containing ions with greater ionic charges.

Ionic compounds **dissolve in polar substances**, such as water. Polar water molecules break down the lattice and surround each ion in solution. Water is polar as the oxygen molecule has two lone pairs of electrons on its far side.

In ionic compounds, the ionic attraction may not be able to break down the lattice structure, meaning it is not very soluble. However, if it has weaker ionic charges it with have a high solubility. For example, $$\text{NaCl}$$ has a solubility (at $$20\degree \text{C}$$) of $$\text{6.1 mol dm}^{-3}$$ whereas $$\text{CaCO}_3$$ is much less soluble at only $$\text{1.3} \times 10^{-4} \text{ mol dm}^{-3}$$.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Solubility** requires two main processes:

* break down of the ionic lattice
* water molecules must attract and surround the ions
{% endhint %}

In their solid state, ionic compounds do not conduct electricity. However, if they are molten or in solution they do **conduct electricity**.

## 5.3 - Covalent bonding

**Covalent bonding** is a strong electrostatic attraction between a shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the bonded atoms. This occurs between atoms in:

* non-metallic elements, such as, $$\text{H}_2$$ and $$\text{O}_2$$
* compounds of non-metallic elements, such as, $$\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
* polyatomic ions, for example, $$\text{NH}_4^+$$

### Exceptions of the octet rule

Some other elements such as boron, can bond covalently with more or less than the expected 8 electrons in their outer shell.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Going Further**_

These exceptions to the octet rule are possible due to hybridisation. **Hybridisation** happens when atomic orbitals mix to form a new atomic orbital. The new orbital can hold the same total number of electrons as the old ones. The properties and energy of the new, hybridized orbital are an 'average' of the original unhybridized orbitals.

### Dative covalent bonds

A **dative covalent** or **coordinate bond** is a covalent bond in which the shared pair of electrons has been supplied by one of the bonding atoms only. In a dative covalent bond, the shared pair was originally a lone pair of electrons on one of the bonded atoms. For example, the ammonium ion,$$\text{NH}_4^+$$, is formed by $$\text{NH}_3$$ and a $$\text{H}^+$$ ion.

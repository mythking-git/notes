# Chapter 3 - Amount of substance

## 3.1 - The mole

$$n$$, the amount of a substance, measured in a unit called the mole $$mol$$. One mole is the amount of a substance that contains $$6.02\times10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$$, the number of particles in each mole of carbon-12.

* 1 mol of $$\text{H}$$: 1 mol of hydrogen atoms
* 1 mol of $$\text{H}_{2}$$: 1 mol of hydrogen molecules

### Molar mass

Molar mass, $$M$$, links the moles of a substance with the mass of any chemical substance

* $$M(C) = 12.0\text{g mol}^{-1}$$
* $$M(\text{NO}_2) = 14.0 + 16.0 \times 2 =  46.0\text{g mol}^{-1}$$
* $$M(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3) = 23.0 \times2+ 12.0 +  16.0\times3 = 106.0\text{g mol}^{-1}$$

$$\text{amount n} = \frac{\text{mass m}}{\text{molar mass M}}$$ or more simply, $$\text{n} = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{M}}$$

## 3.2 - Determination of formulae

Molecular formulae - the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, this is used in equations.

Empirical formulae - the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound, this is used in crystal structure where there are billions of atoms in the molecular formula, so we use the ratio of atoms or ions.

### Hydrated salts

When water molecules are part of their crystalline structure, it is known as water of crystallisation. Each molecule bonds to a certain ratio of water molecules

$$\text{CuSO}_4 \bullet \text{5H}_2\text{O}_{(s)} \rightarrow \text{CuSO}_{4(s)} + \text{5H}_2\text{O}_{(l)}$$

To find the formula of a hydrated salt:

* Weigh an empty crucible.
* Add the hydrated salt and weigh both the crucible and the salt.
* Use a pipe-clay triangle on a tripod, and heat the crucible, gently and then strongly.
* Leave it to cool, and then weigh the crucible and anhydrous salt.

Then to calculate the formula:

* Calculate the amount, in mol, of anhydrous salt, by subtracting the weight of the crucible.
* Calculate the mass and moles of water.
* Find the smallest whole-number ratio by dividing by the smallest amount of moles.
* Write down your calculated ratio in the formula.

## 3.3 - Moles and volumes

### Solutions

* Cubic centimetres and millilitres are equivalent: $$1cm^3 = 1ml$$
* Cubic decimetres and litres are equivalent: $$1dm^3 = 1000cm^3=1000ml=1l$$

$$n=c\times V$$ where $$n$$ is moles, $$c$$ is concentration in $$\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$, and $$V$$ is volume in $$dm^3$$

### Gases

The **molar gas volume** $$V_m$$ is the volume per mole of gas molecules at a stated temperature and pressure. At room temperature ($$25\degree = \text{298K}$$) and pressure ($$\text{1 atm} = \text{101kPa}$$) (RTP), 1 mole of gas molecules has a volume of approximately $$24.0dm^3 = 24000cm^3$$

#### The ideal gas equation

$$\text{pV = nRT}$$

* p = pressure in $$\text{Pa}$$
* V = volume in $$\text{dm}^3$$
* n = number of moles
* R = $$\text{8.314 J mol}^{-1}\text{ K}^{-1}$$
* T = temperature in kelvin ($$\degree + 273$$)

## 3.4 - Reacting quantities

$$\text{percentage yield} = \frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times \text{100\%}$$

$$\text{atom economy} = \frac{\sum \text{desired products } M_r}{\sum \text{total products }M_r} \times \text{100\%}$$&#x20;

# Chapter 3 - Amount of substance

## 3.1 - The mole

$$n$$, the amount of a substance, measured in a unit called the mole $$mol$$. One mole is the amount of a substance that contains $$6.02\times10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$$, the number of particles in each mole of carbon-12.

* 1 mol of $$\text{H}$$: 1 mol of hydrogen atoms
* 1 mol of $$\text{H}_{2}$$: 1 mol of hydrogen molecules

### Molar mass

Molar mass, $$M$$, links the moles of a substance with the mass of any chemical substance

* $$M(C) = 12.0\text{g mol}^{-1}$$
* $$M(\text{NO}_2) = 14.0 + 16.0 \times 2 =  46.0\text{g mol}^{-1}$$
* $$M(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3) = 23.0 \times2+ 12.0 +  16.0\times3 = 106.0\text{g mol}^{-1}$$

$$\text{amount n} = \frac{\text{mass m}}{\text{molar mass M}}$$ or more simply, $$\text{n} = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{M}}$$

## 3.2 - Determination of formulae

Molecular formulae - the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, this is used in equations.

Empirical formulae - the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound, this is used in crystal structure where there are billions of atoms in the molecular formula, so we use the ratio of atoms or ions.

### Hydrated salts

When water molecules are part of their crystalline structure, it is known as water of crystallisation. Each molecule bonds to a certain ratio of water molecules

$$\text{CuSO}_4 \bullet \text{5H}_2\text{O}_{(s)} \rightarrow \text{CuSO}_{4(s)} + \text{5H}_2\text{O}_{(l)}$$

To find the formula of a hydrated salt:\

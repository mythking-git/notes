### Representing wave motion

* A - the amplitude
* $$\lambda$$ - the wavelength
* $$x\text{-axis}$$ - time
* (a) - maximum/peak
* (b) - minimum/trough

### Phase and phasors

**Phase** describes the stage in a wave cycle. Two points are at the same stage in the cycle they are **in phase**.&#x20;

Two waves doing the two opposite things at the same moment are in **antiphase**, for example, points _a_ and _b_ in graph 6.1, are in antiphase.

Phase and phase differences can be measured by a phase angle. We can use a rotating arrow, a **phasor**, to show where the wave is in its cycle.

$$\text{The amplitude of a phasor, is equivalent to a sin } \theta \text{ of it's phase angle }$$

Two waves can interact with each other, if they are $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$radians out of phase (in antiphase) they will entirely cancel out, if not...

### Standing waves

Standing waves are an example of superposition. The principle of superposition is that when two or more waves overlap in space, the resulting wave is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual waves' amplitudes.

To calculate the wavelength of a wave use the equation:

$$\text{wave velocity, } v \text{  (ms}^{-1}) = \text{frequency, }f\text{ (Hz)} \times \text{wavelength, } \lambda \text{ (m)}$$

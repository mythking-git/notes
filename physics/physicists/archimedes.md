### Archimedes' Principle

Archimedes is most well-known for his discovery of the method of finding the volume of an object with an irregular shape. He did this while taking a bath, whereas he entered, the level of the water rose. He was so excited by this discovery that he ran out onto the street naked and shouted "Eureka!" ('I have found \[it]!'). By dividing the mass of the item and the volume of water displaced you can find the density.

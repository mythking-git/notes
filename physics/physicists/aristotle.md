Aristotle, a student of Plato, promoted the early concepts of observing physical phenomena and led to the discovery of the natural laws governing them.

In work surrounding these ideas, _Physics_, he attempted to explain ideas such as motion (and gravity) with the theory of four elements, all made of "aether", they were: earth, water, air, and fire.

In his Aristotelian physics, he wished to establish principles of change that govern all natural bodies, both living, inanimate, celestial, and terrestrial - including change in place, change in size or number, qualitative change, and change of substance or life/existence.

He as a philosophist, applied this to the mind, experiences, memory, anatomy and biology - he combined this all under his term "physics"

> **physics** /ˈfɪzɪks/ is a term that denotes natural science that stems from the english _physic_ 'thing' from the latin _physica_ and Greek _physika_ 'natural things' from _phusis_ 'nature'

Aristotelian physics was enormously popular for many centuries in Europe until the time of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton.

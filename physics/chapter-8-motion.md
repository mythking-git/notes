## 8.1 - Graphs of motion

**Displacement** is the **distance** travelled in a given direction. That's why you can go on a run and be displaced by 0m, despite having travelled. \
In the same way, **speed** is just how fast you are going, whereas velocity also specifies the direction.

### Displacement-time graphs

To find the average velocity on a displacement time graph you can find the quotient of the y-axis (displacement) and the x-axis (time), i.e.,

$$\text{average velocity, v (ms}^{-1}) = \frac{\Delta \text{ in displacement, s (m)}}{\text{total time taken, t (s)}}$$

### Velocity-time graphs&#x20;

In this case, the area under the curve = displacement over the whole journey, and the line shows the velocity at that point in time.&#x20;

To find the acceleration, at a point in time, draw a tangent, and find the gradient of the tangent, this is the acceleration.

* acceleration, $$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$, is the rate of change of velocity, downwards acceleration on earth (gravity) is $$9.81ms^{-2}$$&#x20;

## 8.4 - Speeding up and slowing down

The SUVAT equations are the basis of kinematics, they uses the following variables:

* displacement, $$\text{s }(\text{m})$$
* initial velocity, $$\text{u }(\text{ms}^{-1})$$
* final velocity, $$\text{v }(\text{ms}^{-1})$$
* uniform acceleration, $$\text{a }(\text{ms}^{-2})$$
* time, $$\text{t }(\text{s})$$

### Two-dimensional motion

As displacement, velocity, and acceleration are all vectors, there are often cases where they do not all lie on the same line. To use the equations in these cases, it is necessary to resolve one or more of these values in appropriate directions.

When resolving, you have a choice as to which perpendicular direction you choose to resolve along.

```
A trolley is released from rest to roll a distance of 2.5m along a ramp
inclined at 15 degrees to the horizontal. Calculate the speed it is going when
it reaches the 2.5m mark. You can ignore friction.
```

```
1. Choose two directions at right angles to resolve. In this case it is easier to
   choose one of the directions to be along the ramp, as that is the way the trolley
   is moving.

The components of the acceleration due to gravity, mg, are mg cos, which has no
effect, and mg sin, which accelerates the trolley along the ramp. 

2. List the known variables: 
   Along the ramp, s = 2.5m; u = 0; v = ? a = mg sin; t = ?

3. Find mg sin:
   mg sin 0 = 9.8ms-2 sin (15) = 2.53...ms-2
   
4. Eliminate the unwanted variable; in this case t.

5. Identify the correct equation, the one with s, u, v, and a.
   v^2 = u^2 + 2as

6. Substitute and solve
   = 3.6ms-1 (2 s.f.)

It is important to note that -3.6ms-1 is also a solution, however, the question asked
for speed, so direction is not required.

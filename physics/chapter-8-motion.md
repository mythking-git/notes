## 8.1 - Graphs of motion

**Displacement** is the **distance** travelled in a given direction. That's why you can go on a run and be displaced by 0m, despite having travelled. \
In the same way, **speed** is just how fast you are going, whereas velocity also specifies the direction.

### Displacement-time graphs

To find the average velocity on a displacement time graph you can find the quotient of the y-axis (displacement) and the x-axis (time), i.e.,

$$\text{average velocity, v (ms}^{-1}) = \frac{\Delta \text{ in displacement, s (m)}}{\text{total time taken, t (s)}}$$

### Velocity-time graphs&#x20;

In this case, the area under the curve = displacement over the whole journey, and the line shows the velocity at that point in time.&#x20;

To find the acceleration, at a point in time, draw a tangent, and find the gradient of the tangent, this is the acceleration.

* acceleration, $$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$, is the rate of change of velocity, downwards acceleration on earth (gravity) is $$9.81ms^{-2}$$&#x20;

The SUVAT equations are the basis of kinematics, they uses the following variables:

* displacement, $$\text{s }(\text{m})$$
* initial velocity, $$\text{u }(\text{ms}^{-1})$$
* final velocity, $$\text{v }(\text{ms}^{-1})$$
* uniform acceleration, $$\text{a }(\text{ms}^{-2})$$
* time, $$\text{t }(\text{s})$$
